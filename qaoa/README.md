# Instructions

To run the Python script you have to set the project root to the **qaoa** folder.

``` python
qsharp.init(project_root = './qaoa')

```

> Note: ***Use*** the forward slash (/), the import will fail with backward slash (\).

No such setup is needed for running the notebook just run it as usual.
